This project contains multiple functions and features to make it a polished & immersive experience (even if for just a couple of minutes). This is an older project, made before Unit Circle Visualizer and 2048 in Tkinter, in 2024.

CONTROLS:

H - Hide/show controls

X - Delete all sand

T - Pause/continue simulation

G - Hide/show grid

SCROLL - Zoom in/out

Drag middle mouse button - drags the camera (only possible if zoomed in)

Left mouse button - draw sand

Up arrow - increase simulation speed

Down arrow - decrease simulation speed

R - reset simulation speed to 80 ticks per second

ESC - quit application

The project includes some optimizations that make it less laggy, and should run relatively smoothly unless a large amount of sand is moving at the same time.
